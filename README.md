# who_cited_me

I use this short code snippet to tally the individuals who have shown the most appreciation for and referenced my research papers. The outcomes are derived from Google Scholar search outcomes

I used [Scholarly](https://pypi.org/project/scholarly/) and [ScraperAPI](https://www.scraperapi.com/).
